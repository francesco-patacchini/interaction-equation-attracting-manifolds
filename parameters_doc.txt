Parameters documentation
------------------------


_dim -- space dimension, either 1 or 2 at the moment
_n -- number of particles in the simulation

_initM -- vector containing the initial manifolds, the options being given below
_randomness -- type of initialisation, one of "UG" (uniform grid, only works on
    rectangles for now), "RPUG" (slightly perturbed uniform grid), "RS" (random
    sample)
_amp -- used to quantify the perturbation for "RPUG" above

_scheme -- the numerical scheme used, can be:
    - GFP(tol) for the projected gradient flow with convergence tolerance tol
    - GFeps(tol,ε) for the epsilon gradient flow with convergence tolerance
        given by tol and epsilon parameter ε
    - LBFGS_Optim(tol,ε) for the LBFGS method from the Optim package applied
        to the epsilon interaction energy
    - BFGS_Optim(tol,ε) for the BFGS method from the Optim package, applied
        to the epsilon interaction energy
    - CG_Optim(tol,ε) for the Conjugate Gradient method from the Optim package,
        applied to the epsilon interaction energy
    - GD_Optim(tol,ε) for the Gradient Descent method from the Optim package,
        applied to the epsilon interaction energy
_finalT -- final time of simulation in case we do not want to wait for the
    convergence tolerance to be reached, can be Inf
_corrdt -- a multiplicative factor of the time step so as to increase or
    decrease it, for the GFP and GFeps schemes only
_pert -- whether or not we want to perturb the particles at the end of each
    time step to escape an eventual local minimum, can be true or false
_sampling -- sampling method used to sample the boundary of the manifold, can
    be either "Pointwise" (for a scatter approximation of the boundary) or
    "Linear" (for a piecewise linear approximation)

_W -- interaction potential, can be:
    - Constant() for the potential identically equal to zero
    - Inverse(a,b) for the potential W(r) = 1/(1 + ar^b)
    - InverseAttr(a,b) for the potential W(r) = -1/(1 + ar^b)
    - Exponential(a,b) for W(r) = exp(-ar^b)
    - Linear(a,b) for W(r) = ar^b
_M -- vector of manifolds, each manifold can be:
    - Point1d(c) for a point centred at c in dimension 1
    - R1() for all of R
    - Interval(c,r,s) for an interval centred at c with radius r
    - Point2d(c) for a point centred at c in dimension 2
    - R2() for all of R^2
    - Rectangle(c,a,b,s) for a rectangle centred at c with x-radius a, y-radius
        b
    - Disc(c,r,s) for a disc centred at c with radius r
    - Ellipse(c,a,b,s) for an ellipse centred at c with x-radius a, y-radius b
    - Bean(c,n,s) for a bean centred at c with neck amplitude quantified by n
    - Plectrum(c,α,s) for a weird (plectrum-like) shape centred at c with
        openness parameter α
    (The s parameter stands for the side of the manifold we are interested in,
    can be one of "Int" (interior), "Bdry" (boundary) or "Ext" (exterior).)
_union -- whether we take the union of the manifolds in _M or we take their
    intersection, can be true (for the union) or false (for the intersection)

_plots -- whether or not we plot results (when true, a file named
time_energy.txt is generated together with the plots; it is at each run)
_log -- whether or not the time plots should be on a log scale
_arrows -- whether or not to plot the initial gradient field
_title -- whether or not to show titles on the plots


Note: In order to add interaction potentials and manifolds which are
not listed above, see and amend the source file toolbox.jl at lines 76 through
110 for the potentials and lines 116 through 199 for the manifolds.
